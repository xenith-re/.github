    Xenith is a lightweight Xen-based hypervisor designed for research and development in the realm of operating systems and virtualization. It provides a very stealth environment, advanced debugging capabilities, including low-level insights into guest systems and support for virtual machine introspection.

    Built with performance and stealth in mind, Xenith ensures minimal overhead for seamless execution of virtualized workloads. Its intuitive GUI simplifies management and monitoring, while a robust scripting API enables developers to automate tasks and extend functionality with ease.
